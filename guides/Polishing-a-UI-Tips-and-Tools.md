## Critical Guidelines

Be sure to pay attention to the following elements of beautiful visual design. The devil is in the details. Trust that small improvements can make a big difference on the overall experience:

 - **Colors.** Having three colors (One primary, one secondary, and one accent) used consistently through your app. 
 - **Typography.** Using the correct sizes for different information to create a consistent visual hierarchy 
 - **Iconography.** Icons should generally be a muted single-color (gray, faded colors) and not be too eye-catching unless they are actions or meant to draw attention. 
 - **Spacing.** Make sure you to tighten up spacing of elements. Spacing on the top and bottom should be consistent. Pay attention to proper spacing between elements as well. 
 - **Alignment.** Make sure elements are aligned to a grid. In other words, each view should be aligned to surrounding elements (i.e text to middle of image). 
 - **Information.** Having multiple pieces of text that are all near each other in an item that are exactly the same size, color and style is usually not a good practice. 
 - **Tabs.** Tabs should be a consistent with the background color of the Toolbar above them.

Adhere carefully to the [iconography style guidelines](http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html) for Android
 4. Review **Typography** - Check out the [typography guide](http://developer.android.com/design/style/typography.html) to understand the common font types for Android apps and default type colors and sizes. See the [calligraphy library](https://github.com/chrisjenx/Calligraphy) for easy custom fonts. 
 5. Apply **backgrounds and borders** to views and layouts - Use [[shape and layer drawables|Drawables]] cliffnotes to create colorful backgrounds and borders to your [[buttons|Drawables#customizing-a-button]], [[listviews|Drawables#customizing-a-listview]], and other views. See the [[material card view|Using-the-CardView]] for a look at modern styles for lists.
 6. Improve **ActionBar and Navigation Appearance** -  Review our style guides for the [[ActionBar|Extended-ActionBar-Guide#custom-actionbar-styles]] and [[Tabs guide|Google-Play-Style-Tabs-using-TabLayout#styling-the-tablayout]]. See generators linked in next section.
 7. Follow **Android UI Standards** - Use [[modern material design guidelines|Material-Design-Primer]], [[common navigation styles|Android-Design-Guidelines#common-patterns]]. Review the [[Android Design Guidelines]] with [proper app structure](http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/app-structure.html) and be sure to [design for Android](http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/pure-android.html).
